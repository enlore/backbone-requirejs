## Boilerplates are nice to have around

So this is my Backbone and RequireJS project boilerplate, build process included.

## Needfuls

* Watch the `src` dir and, on filechanges, does any transcompilation needed
  * stylus, but working in other, configurable options would be cool
  * there's also this thing where RequireJS apps can be, like, bundled or something
* Watch the `vendor` dir and copy over vendor libs when added/updated
* RequireJS all wired up into the template
* Arbirtrarily structured app files in `src` deposited into `dist`, maintaining that structure
